      <p>
        Pinball is game that involves the movement and manipulation of a silver
        ball that is contained within a cabinet called a pinball machine. The
        general idea of a pinball game is to hit the ball along the game's
        targets, which includes lights, bumpers, spinners, and ramps, to obtain
        as many points as you can. The player gets three balls per play.

        Pinball games came into prominence during the 1970s, but they have
        existed since the 1930s. The first popular coin-operated pinball machine
        was called <em>'Baffle Ball'</em> and was created David Gottlieb in
        1931, who would go on to found one of the first industry-leading pinball
        manufacturers, <strong>Gottlieb.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As pinball became more popular, new pinball manufacturers were founded
        to compete with success of Gottlieb. They include
        <strong>Williams, Data East, Sega, Bally,</strong> and
        <strong>Stern</strong>. Today, <strong>Stern Pinball, Inc.</strong> is
        one of the only remaining pinball gaming companies producing and
        manufacturing new games. They are known for creating games with a
        mixture of popular and retro themes, such as
        <span class="title">Stranger Things</span>,
        <span class="title">Jurassic Park</span>, and
        <span class="title">Ghostbusters</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite losing popularity in the 80s due to the video game boom, pinball
        arcades have seen a recent revival across the world as retro games have
        come back in fashion with the nostalgia of the millennial generation. It
        is through these new arcades that pinball can be appreciated by the next
        generation!
